📜 DEI - AI Overhaul Submod (Alpha) (v3.5)
A submod for Divide et Impera (DEI) that removes AI cheats, enhances realism, and makes the AI smarter, more dynamic, and unpredictable.

🔹 What is This Mod?
The DEI - AI Overhaul Mod is an AI overhaul submod for Divide et Impera (DEI) in Total War: Rome II.
It reworks AI behavior, diplomacy, economy, and military strategies to create a challenging yet fair campaign experience. This mod is in active development, and is in early testing stages. LOTS TO BE CHANGED STILL!

✅ Key Goals:
✔️ AI follows the same population rules as the player (no infinite recruitment)
✔️ AI no longer cheats manpower, economy, or growth
✔️ AI makes smarter war decisions (realistic invasions, no reckless overextensions)
✔️ Wars feel dynamic and unpredictable (less scripted, more organic conflicts)
✔️ Rome & Carthage rivalry is fully simulated (Punic Wars emerge naturally)
✔️ Balanced Auto-Resolve Battles (No more massive AI advantages)
✔️ AI prioritizes defending and attacking key border settlements

🔹 Major AI Overhauls in This Mod
1️⃣ Smarter Wars & Diplomacy
AI declares wars based on strength, expansion, and strategic opportunities
AI doesn't overextend or fight on too many fronts at once
"Big Wars" (superpowers clashing) vs. "Strike Wars" (smaller AI conflicts)
AI considers alliances, border defenses, and economic stability before waging war
The AI only offers peace if it’s significantly losing, considering factors like manpower losses, lost territories, and prolonged war duration. If a faction has been at war for 20+ turns, lost key regions, and suffered major defeats, it will attempt to negotiate peace—unless it’s a superpower like Rome or Carthage, which fights until severely beaten
AI factions actively scan for poorly defended enemy settlements and take initiative when an opportunity arises. If a bordering enemy region has low garrison strength and the AI has an army nearby, it will prioritize attacking instead of aimlessly moving or raiding. This ensures wars feel more dynamic and realistic, with factions taking strategic settlements rather than wandering aimlessly
2️⃣ AI Respects Population & Manpower
AI cannot recruit infinitely (must manage population like the player)
AI suffers manpower shortages after long wars
More realistic military growth and recruitment pacing
3️⃣ AI Sieges & Sally-Outs Improved
AI actually holds sieges instead of randomly raiding
AI only sallies out if it has a real advantage (no more suicidal charges)
Smarter garrison management and reinforcements
4️⃣ Rome vs. Carthage: Dynamic Punic Wars
Rome and Carthage start neutral but tensions gradually increase over time
War is triggered by expansion into Sicily, Sardinia, or Corsica
If neither expands, war still happens eventually (increases in probability over time)
5️⃣ Balanced Auto-Resolve Battles
AI no longer gets massive auto-resolve bonuses
Majors are still strong, but not unfairly OP
Minor factions have a fair chance to survive and grow
6️⃣ AI Public Order & Economy Fixes
AI manages instability better (no more constant rebellions)
AI builds public order structures when necessary (they no longer have free public order bonuses)
AI taxes & recruits smarter to avoid bankrupting itself (removed money cheats)


🔥 What’s New in v3.5?
(March 2025 Update - Testing Build)

✅ Major AI Upgrades:

AI sallies out less frequently (only if they have an actual chance to win)
AI sieges are more calculated (less random raiding, smarter hold tactics)
AI prioritizes reinforcements for border settlements
Wars are more strategic, less reckless (factions won’t suicide into unwinnable wars)

✅ New Punic War System:

Rome & Carthage gradually drift toward war (higher probability over time)
If Sicily, Sardinia, or Corsica is taken, war triggers immediately
Guaranteed war by turn 50 if neither faction has already started it

✅ Smarter Army Behavior:

AI stops retreating unnecessarily (only backs off if outnumbered 2:1)
AI reinforces border settlements instead of leaving them empty
AI targets weak enemy border settlements more aggressively

✅ Economy & Recruitment Fixes:

AI respects manpower/population limits when recruiting
AI builds economy before spamming armies
AI handles public order better (fewer self-inflicted rebellions)
